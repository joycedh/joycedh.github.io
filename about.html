    <h1>AttnGAN art by Joyce den Hertog</h1>
    <p class = "info">The artworks that you will find on this page are created by a GAN. 
        GANs are algorithms that learn how to generate fake images from a dataset of example images, 
        by trying to come as close to the example images as possible, but not overdoing this (otherwise the images would turn out the same as the examples).
        A famous example of this is the website <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>, which shows images of fake people, generated by a GAN.

        Currently I am writing my thesis about generating art with GANs from text, especially newspaper captions. 
        Therefore, you will find that the titles of the artworks represent a newspaper article from the NYTimes of February 2020. 
        I am trying to explore whether the GAN can artistically portray  can convey an aesthetic experience related to the contents, tone, mood, or vibe of a newspaper article.

        I used <a href="https://github.com/taoxugit/AttnGAN">AttnGAN</a> and trained it on the 
        <a href="http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html"> Wikiart Emotions Dataset</a> to generate the artworks.
