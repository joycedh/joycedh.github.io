<em>You Make Me Glow</em> is an artificial creature that displays the emotion of having a crush on someone. The behavior of the creature is expressed by various chemical reactions such as the chemical luminescence behavior of luminol. The crushing behavior is initiated when someone steps closer to the creature. The closer you are the more the creature will start to blush. When the crush is reciprocated by the user the creature overflows with emotion which can directly be observed in the emergence of foam.
