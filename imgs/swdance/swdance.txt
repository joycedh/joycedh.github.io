For my thesis at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/media-technology">MSc Media Technology,</a> I trained a text-to-motion diffusion model (AI) that generates dance from poetical text input on my own dataset. The aim of this research was to explore subjectivity and creativity in text-to-motion AI. In the future, I would like to translate its generated movement into a real-life dance performance. The paper has been presented and published at the <a target="_blank" href="null"&gt;Motion Computing Conference '24</a> in Utrecht.
