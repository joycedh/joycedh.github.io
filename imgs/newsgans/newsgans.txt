For my Bachelor's Thesis, I trained GANs on a dataset of artworks and their titles, and provided them with new textual input of newspaper headlines. The aim of this process was to see whether GANs would be able to create accurate artistic representations of the news. To measure this, I gauged peoples responses and emotions on the works, and contextualised the works in the broader scene of GAN art and artists. The final paper was published in AUC's undergraduate journal InPrint: <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-swW3QcRDFAkwnTOjUcLWZGkVxTrSeQJ/view">Capstone issue, Volume 14.</a>
