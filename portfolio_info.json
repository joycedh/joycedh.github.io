            "In the digital world, a blue screen signifies malfunction, error, system crash, emptiness. On the other hand, the modernist monochromatic paintings have an indescribable feeling of depth to them, due to endless layering of pigments. Barnett Newman uses this technique in his painting \u2018<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.stedelijk.nl/en/collection/1376-barnett-newman-cathedra\">Cathedra</a>\u2019, making the blue feel heavy and deep. Can the same effect be achieved by layering different shades of blue on a digital screen?&nbsp; Can I then turn the negative connotations of this so called <i>screen of death</i> into a work of art? BlueScreen was created during CCBT's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ccbt.rekibun.or.jp/en/events/future-ideations-camp01\">Future Ideations Camp Vol. 1</a>.

The behavior of the creature is expressed by various chemical reactions such as the chemical luminescence behavior of luminol. The crushing behavior is initiated when someone steps closer to the creature. The closer you are the more the creature will start to blush. When the crush is reciprocated by the user the creature overflows with emotion which can directly be observed in the emergence of foam.

The aim of this process was to see whether GANs would be able to create accurate artistic representations of the news.

            "For my thesis at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/media-technology\">MSc Media Technology,</a> I trained a text-to-motion diffusion model (AI) that generates dance from poetical text input on my own dataset. The aim of this research was to explore subjectivity and creativity in text-to-motion AI. In the future, I would like to translate its generated movement into a real-life dance performance. The paper has been presented and published at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moco24.movementcomputing.org/\">Motion Computing Conference '24</a> in Utrecht."

            "For the final project of the first year of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/media-technology\">MSc Media Technology,</a> we had to create an interactive work which showcased our research perspective on the theme \u2018Hybrid\u2019.&nbsp;Our group chose to study the concept <i>Heterotopia</i>, coined by Michael Foucault. A <i>heterotopia</i> is a place in between places, a space within a space. It contradicts or inverts the space in which it is within (Foucault, 1994). A public toilet is a good example of this, as it is simultaneously a private space within a very public space.&nbsp;In We_Connect, we wanted to show the audience that a public toilet in a public space is in fact, very public. Therefore, we decided to make a video call connection with the toilet inside the exhibition space. A ring went off in the exhibition space whenever someone entered the toilet. The person in the toilet would find a big screen facing them, with the other person talking to them and asking questions. They could talk back if they want, or mute themselves if they wanted more privacy for doing their business; this would not make the person on the screen disappear."
